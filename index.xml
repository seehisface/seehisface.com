The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/page/about/</guid><description>Welcome! This site will be an overview and study of books of the bible, along with deeper looks into specific topics.
Along the way there will be reviews and recommendations of books, audio and video, along with anything else I think others would find beneficial.

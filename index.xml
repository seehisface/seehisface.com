These are quite brilliant, and highly recommended.
The MLJ Trust has made available over 1600 recorded sermons from the great man himself, all for free.
There is also a mobile app available, which makes the collections easy to navigate, has a built in player, and has a significant introduction to each sermon.</description></item><item><title>The Forbidden Chapter Isaiah 53</title><link>/video/the-forbidden-chapter-isaiah-53/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:53:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/the-forbidden-chapter-isaiah-53/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I came across Tree of Life Ministries, and specifically this really great demonstration of using Isaiah 53 in preaching to Jews.&lt;/p>

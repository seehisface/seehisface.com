69 episodes long, it starts with an introduction as to why church history is important, before giving an overview of the cultural backdrop that the early church found it self in.
The series the moves on the from the church fathers, through the nicene period, the introduction of Islam and the impact that has on the church, then on to the schisms and eventually the reformation, with much else in between.<div class=read-more><a href=/audio/james_white_church_history/>Read more...</a></div></div></div></article><article class=post-preview><a href=/bible-listening-times/><h2 class=post-title>Bible Listening Times</h2></a><div class=post-meta><span class=post-meta>May 1, 2020</span></div><div class=post-content><div class=post-entry><p>These are times I have extracted from a particular audio bible I like listening to, the dramatized ESV by <a href=https://www.faithcomesbyhearing.com/>Faith Comes By Hearing</a>.

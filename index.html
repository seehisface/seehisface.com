Created by Dallas Jenkins, a Christian and a director, writer and film producer, the show is already The highest crowd-funded TV series or film of all time.
The following is from their site and pretty much sums up what it is about:
The Chosen is the first-ever-multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus.

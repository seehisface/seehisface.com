These are quite brilliant, and highly recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.mljtrust.org/" target="_blank">MLJ Trust&lt;/a> has made available over 1600 recorded sermons from the great man himself, all for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also a mobile app available, which makes the collections easy to navigate, has a built in player, and has a significant introduction to each sermon.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

These are quite brilliant, and highly recommended.
The MLJ Trust has made available over 1600 recorded sermons from the great man himself, all for free.
There is also a mobile app available, which makes the collections easy to navigate, has a built in player, and has a significant introduction to each sermon.</description></item></channel></rss>

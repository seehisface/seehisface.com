69 episodes long, it starts with an introduction as to why church history is important, before giving an overview of the cultural backdrop that the early church found itself in.
The series the moves on the from the church fathers, through the nicene period, the introduction of Islam and the impact that has on the church, then on to the schisms and eventually the reformation, with much else in between.</description></item><item><title>Bible Listening Times</title><link>/audio/2020-05-01-bible-listening-times/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 16:47:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>/audio/2020-05-01-bible-listening-times/</guid><description>Below are the listening times for a particular audio bible I like listening to, the dramatized ESV by Faith Comes By Hearing .
These are the times for the individual books, and for the sections, overall, the whole bible takes just over 80 hours, if listened to at normal speed.
It may be helpful for some people to use for planning listening. Most people read quite a bit faster than they speak, so you could probably half these amount for reading times.</description></item><item><title>Martyn Lloyd Jones Resources</title><link>/audio/martyn-lloyd-jones-resources/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:34:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>/audio/martyn-lloyd-jones-resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am quite the fan of listening to podcasts and whatnot as I drive around in my van, and I have recently been listening to various Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones audio sermons.

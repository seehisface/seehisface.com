69 episodes long, it starts with an introduction as to why church history is important, before giving an overview of the cultural backdrop that the early church found itself in.
The series the moves on the from the church fathers, through the nicene period, the introduction of Islam and the impact that has on the church, then on to the schisms and eventually the reformation, with much else in between.</description></item><item><title>Martyn Lloyd Jones Resources</title><link>/audio/martyn-lloyd-jones-resources/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:34:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>/audio/martyn-lloyd-jones-resources/</guid><description>I am quite the fan of listening to podcasts and whatnot as I drive around in my van, and I have recently been listening to various Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones audio sermons. These are quite brilliant, and highly recommended.
The MLJ Trust has made available over 1600 recorded sermons from the great man himself, all for free.
There is also a mobile app available, which makes the collections easy to navigate, has a built in player, and has a significant introduction to each sermon.</description></item></channel></rss>
